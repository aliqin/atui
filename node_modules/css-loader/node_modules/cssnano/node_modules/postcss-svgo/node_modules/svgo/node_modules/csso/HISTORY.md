## 1.4 (October 16, 2015)

Bringing project back to life. Changed files structure, cleaned up and refactored most of sources.

### Common

- build browser version with `browserify` (no more `make`, and `web` folder), browser version is available at `dist/csso-browser.js`
- main file is `lib/index.js` now
- minimal `node.js` version is `0.12` now

- add `jscs` to control code style
- automate `gh-pages` update
- util functions reworked
- translator reworked
- test suite reworked
- compressor refactored
- initial parser refactoring

### API

- new method `minify(src, options)`, options:
  - `restructuring` â€“ if set to `false`, disable structure optimisations (`true` by default)
  - `debug` - outputs intermediate state of CSS during compression (`false` by default)
- deprecate `justDoIt()` method (use `minify` instead)
- rename `treeToString()` method to `stringify()`
- drop `printTree()` method
- AST node info
  - `column` and `offset` added
  - `ln` renamed to `line`
  - fix line counting across multiple files and input with CR LF (#147)

### CLI

- completely reworked, use [clap](https://github.com/lahmatiy/clap) to parse argv
- add support for input from stdin (#128)
- drop undocumented and obsoleted options `--rule` and `--parser` (suppose nobody use it)
- drop `-off` alias for `--restructure-off` as incorrect (only one letter options should starts with single `-`)
- new option `--debug` that reflecting to `options.debug` for `minify`
